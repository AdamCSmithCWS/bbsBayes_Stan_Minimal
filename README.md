# bbsBayes\_Stan\_Minimal

This is an minimum working example of an early attempt to use Stan to fit a relatively simple hierarchical model applied to data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey.

I'm trying to build a Stan version of the JAGS models currently used to analyse the North American Breeding Bird Survey monitoring data . This repo includes a minimal example of one of the simplest models for a species that provides a reasonably representative example set up to use only the most recent 20-years of data as a simplification.
